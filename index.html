        <h2>Croissant - what is it?</h2>
        <p>
          A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired
          by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
          yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
          historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
          and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
          in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
          flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

        <h2>History of croissants</h2>
        <p>
          The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate
          the defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours
          in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was
          invented in Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to
          celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege
          of the city, as a reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags,
          when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and
          gave the alarm.

        <h2>Variants</h2>
        <p>
          Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline,
          almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it
          becomes like pain au chocolat, which has a different, non-crescent,
          shape), or sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be
          flavored with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits
          such as apples. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold
          without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with
          almond filling. In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are
          sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese,
          or feta cheese and spinach. In the Levant, croissants are sold plain
          or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar. In Germany,
          croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern
          Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with
          lye (Laugencroissant). In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the
          croissant is typically called a Gipfeli; this usually has a crisper
          crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.
